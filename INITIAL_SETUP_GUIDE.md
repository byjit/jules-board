# Overview

This is an initial setup guide for the project. Only run this if you are asked to specifically by the user. Never run it on your own.

The first step is to collect information about what the project is and what it does.
If the user has not provided this information, ask them for it first. Only after you have this information, proceed with the following setup instructions:

1. create a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`.
2. Update the project name and project description in `package.json`.
3. Update the project overview section in `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` with the project related information.
4. Tailor the `manifest.ts` and `layout.tsx` files with the new project details.
5. Update the `src/lib/constant.ts` file with relevant constants for the new project.
